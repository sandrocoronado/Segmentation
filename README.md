# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis
In this project, we utilized the provided eCommerce dataset to implement a Customer Segmentation model using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis method. The primary objective was to group customers based on their recent purchasing behavior, purchase frequency, and monetary value, enabling targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies. The tasks included data preprocessing, RFM metric calculation, segmentation, clustering using K-Means, segment profiling, marketing recommendations, and visualization creation. Additionally, we addressed specific questions related to data overview, customer analysis, product analysis, time analysis, geographical analysis, payment analysis, customer behavior, returns and refunds, profitability analysis, and customer satisfaction. The project involved exploring the dataset's characteristics, customer purchasing patterns, product insights, time-related trends, geographical distribution, payment methods, customer behavior segmentation, returns and refunds analysis, profitability, and potential customer satisfaction feedback or ratings. The findings and recommendations were documented comprehensively in a report.
